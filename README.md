# world-happiness-24-EDA
An exploratory data analysis project on the world happiness in 2024. 

After taking my human happiness class my sophomore year, I became curious about the happiness levels across the globe, and how the data has changed over the years. In class, we looked at the distribution of happiness levels by age. It was interesting to see that the happiest people were in the age ranges of 60-70 years old. As college students, we are often told that these will be the best years of our life. But is that really the case if the happiest people reported are 40 years our seniors? In this project, I wanted to explore the causes of happiness levels in adolescents, young adults, and seniors. 

The World Happiness Report 2024 did not provide data in the form of a csv, so it was created using the function in the file ___.
