# World Happiness Explored Through Age
An exploratory data analysis project on the world happiness in 2024. 

## Introduction
After taking my human happiness class my sophomore year, I became curious about the happiness levels across the globe, and how the data has changed over the years. In class, we looked at the distribution of happiness levels by age. It was interesting to see that the happiest people were in the age ranges of 60-70 years old, creating a U-shaped curve starting from birth to the age 90. As college students, we are often told that these will be the best years of our life. But is that really the case if the happiest people reported are 40 years our seniors? The purpose of this is to explore how/if the curve has changed, and the patterns among the countries listed. 

## Questions Being Explored:
1. Does a country's overall happiness score correlate with the size of the happiness gap between its young and old citizens?
2. Among the top 20 happiest countries (by score), is there a pattern? Do they tend to be better for the old, the young, or are they balanced?
3. Do countries with low overall happiness scores tend to have more extreme generational divides in their happiness rankings? 

## Observations


### Imperfect Data
The data that is currently being used has discrepencies due to the fact that I don't have access to the raw data for the happiness scores for the different age groups across the countries. However, we are still able to make estimates. 

## Conclusion
